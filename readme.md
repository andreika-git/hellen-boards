Hellen-One is a DIY PnP ECU board construction toolset for [rusEFI](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi)!

There are several scripts in the root folder showing how to use Hellen One for board creation.
To run the scripts, you need a 'bash' environment available natively as Unix/Linux shells.
Or, under Windows, you'll need to install a special environment like MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com)
